### Set Environment Variables
Before running the sample application, set environment variables `PANGEA_DOMAIN` and `PANGEA_AUDIT_TOKEN` to the values copied from the Pangea Console during the service configuration.

#### Example (bash):
```bash
export PANGEA_DOMAIN="aws.eu.pangea.cloud"
export PANGEA_AUDIT_TOKEN="yourAccessToken"
```

### Run the Python Example (GitHub)

API Reference
Overview
The Pangea service APIs are oriented around a JSON-RPC-like call. While not exactly mirroring JSON-RPC entirely, some general design philosophies are followed. A JSON-RPC-like request paradigm was chosen to ensure our APIs have a predictable, easy-to-understand, and secure method of use.

We have chosen to diverge from JSON-RPC for ease of use. Our specific differences are as follows:

The action name and version are part of the URI and not a parameter in the JSON body.
If only one record is requested, by ID, from a specified service, a GET request can be made with a REST-style request.
URI Structure
The Pangea URIs are designed to be predictable and easy to read.

POST: https://<service>.<csp>.<geo>.pangea.cloud/<version>/<resource>/<action>

<service>
The name of the Pangea service (for example, redact, audit, intelligence)
<csp>
The name of the CSP with which your Pangea project is configured (for example, aws, gcp)
